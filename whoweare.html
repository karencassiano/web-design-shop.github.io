 <p> UPlusUs Began in 2005, inspired by a simple proble. </p>
 <P> Our founder, Karin Cassiano, has a wardrobe full of unused clothes taking up space. Every month, she donated bags of clothing to charity. While she loved helping others, she realized there could be more impact- a way to earn from unused clothes, help others to do the same, and support recycling at the same time.</p>
 <p> That idea became UPlusUs: a plataform built on sharing value, reducing waste, and making fashion more suistainablefor everyone. </p>
